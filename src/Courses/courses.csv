BB 331,*INTRODUCTION TO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,"Course dealing with the molecular basis of cellular function, with emphasis upon modern developments, and the foundation for practical applications of this knowledge. The course will involve the conceptual background necessary to appreciate the applications of molecular biology. Throughout the course opportunities will be given to discuss public policy issues and questions: What are the moral and practical problems that flow from identification of an individual as being at risk for a late-appearing genetic disorder, such as Huntington's disease or certain cancers? Does the scientific or public value of knowing the entire DNA sequence of the human genome justify a situation in which individual or small-scale research cannot be supported? What issues arise when the fruits of biological research, mostly publicly funded, are commercialized? Should a novel organism be patented? How can biotechnology be applied to environmental problems? (Bacc Core Course)"
BB 332,*MOLECULAR MEDICINE,"Provides students an understanding of medical advances from a rapidly evolving molecular point of view. Advances in knowledge of the human genome arising from DNA sequencing efforts and major leaps in understanding of the regulating cellular growth and division are presented in an easy-to-understand fashion appropriate for students in all majors. Course discussions and assignments will cover implications of advances in molecular medicine from ethical, economic, technical and societal standpoints. The aim of the course is to present technical material in a way that non-scientists will understand and conversely to summarize ethical, economic, and philosophical considerations in a way that the scientists understand the implications of these technologies.

BOT 474X,INTRODUCTION TO GENOME BIOLOGY,"Explores how genomes underlie and influence biological phenomena, across the diversity of life, from prokaryotic microbes to eukaryotic multicellular organisms. Covers genome organization: the structure of chromosomes and chromatin; genes and gene families; and mechanisms that remodel genomes, such as mutation, recombination and transposable elements in the first part of the course. Focuses on genome expression and regulation: gene expression, cellular functions and biochemical pathways; transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms; and genotype-to-phenotype relationships in the second part of the course. Emphasizes the use of recent technological advances and genome-wide assays that enable investigation of these topics."

Faculty describe research projects and experimental approaches, and pose interesting political and ethical questions related to scientific research. Students work with junior and senior student mentors already involved in research projects. Offered fall term."
BRR 401,RESEARCH AND SCHOLARSHIP,"Undergraduate mentored research. Students select a faculty research mentor (from 7 OSU colleges) and complete 14 credits of research. Students follow established guidelines to prepare project proposals, progress reports, and a thesis; learn research methods applicable to their chosen field; gain professional skills and contacts. Students are evaluated on their ability to develop and complete a research project proposal, learn and develop research methodologies, conduct research and trouble-shooting procedures, and demonstrate responsible and ethical participation in the research project. Offered all terms."
BRR 403,^THESIS,BRR students independently interpret and present their research in writing. Students write the thesis in a style appropriate for submission to a peer-reviewed journal in their chosen scientific discipline. Students receive a letter grade based on their final thesis. Timeliness of reports is factored in student assessments. The student's faculty mentor and the BRR Director provide a consensus grade when the thesis is completed. Offered all terms.
